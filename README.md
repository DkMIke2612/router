## 🔧 How to Use
With **router**, you can set up your app's routing by creating a folder structure that matches your desired URL paths. Each folder can contain a file named `index.tsx` or `index.jsx` based on your choice of JavaScript or TypeScript.

### Example Structure
- `/src`
  - `/routes`
    - `/home`
      - `index.tsx`  *(This corresponds to the "/home" route)*
    - `/about`
      - `index.tsx`  *(This corresponds to the "/about" route)*
    - `/products`
      - `index.tsx`  *(This corresponds to the "/products" route)*

### Importing the Router
To use **router** in your project, you need to import it into your main application file, typically `App.tsx` or `App.jsx`.

```javascript
import { Router } from 'router';
```

Then, wrap your app’s components with the **Router**:

```javascript
function App() {
    return (
        <Router>
            {/* Your routes/components here */}
        </Router>
    );
}
```
